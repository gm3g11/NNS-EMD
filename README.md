# NNS-EMD

Welcome to the official repository for the research paper titled "Efficient Approximation of Earth Mover's Distance Based on Nearest Neighbor Search."

## Overview
The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is a measure of the dissimilarity between two multivariate distributions. Our paper presents a novel approach to approximate the EMD efficiently using Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) techniques. This repository will provide the implementation of our proposed method, facilitating replication of our results and further research in the field.

## Paper
