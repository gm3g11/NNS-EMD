# NNS-EMD

Welcome to the official repository for the research paper titled "Efficient Approximation of Earth Mover's Distance Based on Nearest Neighbor Search."

## Overview
The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is a measure of the dissimilarity between two multivariate distributions. Our paper presents a novel approach to approximate the EMD efficiently using Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) techniques. This repository will provide the implementation of our proposed method, facilitating replication of our results and further research in the field.

## Paper
The preprint of our research paper is available on arXiv:

We encourage readers to refer to this preprint for detailed information about the method, theoretical analysis, and experimental results.

## Code Release
The source code for our algorithm, as described in the paper, will be released shortly. The codebase will include all necessary scripts to run the NNS-EMD algorithm on your data.
